## Hypnotherapy

### About
Hypnotherapy is a state of keen awareness. The subject is wide-awake and aware of everything around them.

For those who have not experienced Hypnotherapy, it's nothing like stage hypnosis. It's more like a focused dream in which your logical mind is switched off for a while, allowing your subconscious to make real and lasting changes to the way you live.

Clinical Hypnotherapy is a form of Psychotherapy that is used to create subconscious change in a person in the form of new responses, thoughts, attitudes, behaviours and feelings.
