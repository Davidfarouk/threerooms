Reflexology is based on the theory that certain reflex points on the feet correspond with various organs and structure of the body. 
By applying pressure to the feet using thumb, finger or hand to specific reflex points the Reflexologist therapist can detect subtle changes in the body and by stimulating these points may bring about balance and well-being.
