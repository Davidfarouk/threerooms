What is the Alexander Technique?
The Alexander Technique: Improve Posture, Reduce Pain, and Enhance Well-being
The Alexander Technique is a practical method for improving posture, movement, and overall body awareness. It teaches individuals how to reduce unnecessary tension and move more efficiently, promoting better balance, coordination, and ease in daily activities.
Developed by Frederick Matthias Alexander in the late 19th century, the Alexander Technique is a holistic approach to re-educating the body and mind. It focuses on identifying and changing harmful postural habits that contribute to discomfort, pain, and restricted movement. By learning to move with greater awareness and efficiency, individuals can prevent strain and improve their overall well-being
