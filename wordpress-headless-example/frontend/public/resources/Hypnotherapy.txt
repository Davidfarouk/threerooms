What to expect from Hypnotherapy?
Hypnotherapy is a state of keen awareness. The subject is wide-awake and aware of everything around them.

For those of you who have not experienced Hypnotherapy, it’s nothing like stage hypnosis (in other words, you won’t leave the session quacking like a duck).  It’s more like a focused dream in which your logical mind is switched off for a while, allowing your subconscious (the really powerful part) to make real and lasting changes to the way you live.

Clinical Hypnotherapy is a form of Psychotherapy that is used to create subconscious change in a person in the form of new responses, thoughts, attitudes, behaviours and feelings.
