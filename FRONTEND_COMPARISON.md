# Frontend Directory Comparison

## Summary
The `d:\lucie\frontend\` folder is an **OLD/DUPLICATE** version. The **ACTIVE** project is in `d:\lucie\wordpress-headless-example\frontend\`.

## Key Differences

### ❌ OLD: `d:\lucie\frontend\` (DUPLICATE - Should be deleted)

**Has (that main project doesn't):**
- `case-study/` pages (old feature, not in current project)
- `ParallaxSection.tsx` component (we removed this)
- Old `.txt` files in resources (we cleaned these)
- `CONTENT - NEW WEBSITE 2025.xlsx` file
- Fewer therapist headshots

**Missing (that main project has):**
- `AboutPageClient.tsx` (separate client component for About page)
- `ScrollProgress.tsx` (scroll progress bar component)
- `SkeletonCard.tsx` (loading skeleton component)
- `analytics.ts` (analytics utilities)
- `next-env.d.ts` (Next.js type definitions)
- `node_modules/` (dependencies not installed)
- Newer therapist headshots (Aimee, Chrissy, Elizabeth, Melika)
- Clean resources (no .txt files)

### ✅ CURRENT: `d:\lucie\wordpress-headless-example\frontend\` (ACTIVE PROJECT)

**Has all the latest:**
- ✅ Clean component structure (no ParallaxSection)
- ✅ ScrollProgress component
- ✅ Analytics utilities
- ✅ Complete About page with client component
- ✅ All latest therapist headshots
- ✅ Clean resources folder
- ✅ Installed dependencies
- ✅ All UI/UX improvements we made

## Recommendation

**DELETE** `d:\lucie\frontend\` - it's an outdated duplicate that will cause confusion.

The active project is in `wordpress-headless-example/frontend/` and that's what you should use.
